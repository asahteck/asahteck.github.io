hi! I'm ASAhteck.
======
You've stumbled upon the personal website of Amanda Shayna Ahteck, known to the research community as Shayna Ahteck, and often known personally by the nickname Asa.
My kerberos while at MIT was asahteck, so that's my username across platforms.

I graduated in Course 2A from the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT, though my interests in fabircation also involve computation. 

My degree is available [here.](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/78497d08adb75899a4778d2b8ead917a)
